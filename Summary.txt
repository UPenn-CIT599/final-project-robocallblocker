Program Name: 
Robo-Call Blocker 

Description: 
Program first generates the user's contact list by randomly taking 40 to 60 contacts from a csv file filled with 198 contacts. Each one of these contacts may consist of some or all of the following: name, company, address, city, county, state, zip, phone number, email, and social media. The program then creates a caller by randomly taking a contact from the csv file and then comparing it to the user's contact list to determine whether or not it is spam. For each call, the user is given the option to accept and then start a new call or to decline and generate a list of callers that were determined to be spam. The program also outputs a text file of these callers who were blocked.

Work Breakdown: 

Shawn - 
Created initial ContactInfo class to have an object hold various contact information attributes such as name, number, email address, etc. Created initial ContactInfoReader class to process our CSV file of contact information to populate a hashmap of keys and ContactInfo objects. Created initial UsersContactList class which essentially creates the user's contact list by randomly picking contacts from the CSV file using collections.shuffle to shuffle the keys. Josh and Thomas also significantly contributed to these classes. Contributed to Thomas's initial SpamAlgorithm class by tweaking the conditional statements to exclude values where cells were empty or zero. Additionally, tweaked the class to add the blockList logic inside the compareAgainst() method. Contributed to Phone class with initial ringtone method using AudioInputStream; Thomas helped me refine this. Next, added the blockList logic to output a text file of the list of spam callers using FileWriter and StringBuilder to display the list in the GUI. Lastly, added the BlockButton and ActionListener into Josh's initial GUI class. Josh helped me refine the output.

Worked on CallBlockerGUI class button action listener and control of ringtone start and stop. Worked on IncomingCall class to randomly generate a caller from CSV HashMap. Worked on Phone class to class upon other classes to generate CSV HashMap, user's contact list, random caller, and compare caller to user's contact list. Worked on SpamAlgorithm class to compare caller to user's contact list based on number of matches. Worked on UsersContactList class to create user contact list from CSV HashMap. Worked to create JUnit tests for CallBlockerGUI, ContactInfoReader,  and SpamAlgorithm
